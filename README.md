**Repository Title:** Customer Churn Prediction

**Description:**

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction repository! This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn in a business, an essential task for improving customer retention and business profitability. Customer churn, often referred to as customer attrition, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Exploration:** Explore and understand the dataset containing historical customer data, including demographics, subscription details, and usage patterns.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and analyze customer behavior to uncover insights that may lead to churn.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Build and train machine learning models to predict customer churn. Experiment with various algorithms and hyperparameters.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Compare and select the best-performing model.

- **Deployment:** Deploy the selected model to make real-time predictions or integrate it into a business application.

- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation and Jupyter notebooks for each step of the analysis, making it easy to understand and reproduce the results.
